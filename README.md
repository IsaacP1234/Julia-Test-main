# Julia-Test
Generates random undirected graph with 4 to 10 vertices and 0 to the maximum number possible for the graph edges. 
Generates Stabilzer Tableau of graph
Adds each row in the tablaue to a set
Multiples each stablizer in the set with each other stabilizer and adds results to set
Repeats until no new states are added
The resulting set contains all the stabilzers of the graph state.
